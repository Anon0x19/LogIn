# LogIn System
Login System for a Swift Application using FireBase in MacOS

To run it:
- Firstly you need to make sure you have CocoaPods installed and extract the folder to that same directory in which you will be running the app from.
- You will then have to navitage to the directory in which you have saved the podfile and run `pod install` in terminal.
- You will then have to open the .xcworkspace application.
- Setup the FirebaseAuth, start by downloading you GoogleService-Info.plist and move it into the folder.
- Run it through your phone or via the iPhone 11 Simulator.



Why FireBase?
- I decided to use FireBase since I could Easily Implement Google Auth
